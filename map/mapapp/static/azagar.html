                    Madurai Azhagar Temple, also known as Kallazhagar Temple, is a famous Hindu temple located about 20 km from Madurai,
                     Tamil Nadu. It is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is worshipped here as Kallazhagar or Sundararaja Perumal.
                      The temple is situated at the foothills of the Alagar Hills, surrounded by natural beauty and greenery.
                       The temple’s architecture reflects the splendid Dravidian style, with beautifully carved pillars and
                        tall gopurams. One of the major festivals celebrated here is the Chithirai Festival, during which
                         Lord Azhagar is believed to visit Madurai to bless his devotees. The event attracts thousands of 
                         people every year and fills the city with devotion and celebration. The temple’s peaceful
                          environment and historical significance make it one of the most revered pilgrimage sites in South India.
