                    Thirumalai Nayakar Mahal, located in the heart of Madurai, is a magnificent palace built in 1636 AD by King Thirumalai Nayak of the Nayak dynasty,
                     who ruled the region between 1623 and 1659. Once a sprawling palace complex said to be four times larger than what remains today, it originally
                      consisted of two main sections—Swarga Vilasam (Celestial Pavilion) and Ranga Vilasam—with gardens, ponds, shrines, apartments, and grand halls,
                       though only a portion of this survives now. The palace is a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, beautifully blending Dravidian, Islamic,
                        and European styles, and is renowned for its massive arches, ornate stucco work, and towering pillars that rise nearly 13 meters high. The Swarga
                         Vilasam, with its giant dome and intricate ceiling decorations, served as the throne hall and remains the highlight of the structure.
