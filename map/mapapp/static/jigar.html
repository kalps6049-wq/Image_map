                    Jigarthanda is a very popular and refreshing cold beverage that originated in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, 
                    and is now loved all across South India. The name “Jigarthanda” literally means “cooling the heart”,
                     and true to its name, it is known for its rich, cooling effect, especially in the hot climate of Madurai.
                      This unique drink is prepared using ingredients like thick milk, almond gum (badam pisin), sarsaparilla 
                      syrup (nannari), sugar, and generous scoops of creamy ice cream, giving it a thick, milkshake-like texture
                       and a naturally sweet taste. Unlike regular soft drinks, Jigarthanda is considered healthy and natural 
                       because of the cooling properties of badam pisin and nannari, which are traditional remedies for body heat.
                        It has become one of the most iconic food identities of Madurai, attracting tourists and food lovers from
                         all over who never miss tasting it during their visit to the city.
